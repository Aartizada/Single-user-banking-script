#### A solution for people paid in cash
I am self-learning software development.

I found it difficult to track payments made in cash, therefore I created this terminal application to keep a record of spending.


#### Future wishes
- Data analysis of user log files. Would be lovely to have monthly/yearly stats, as well as graphs to plot income and spending. 
- Simple GUI
- Batch file to run program without terminal know-how.
