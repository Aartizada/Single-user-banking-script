# Single-user-banking-script

### A solution for people paid in cash
I am self-learning software development.

I found it difficult to track payments made in cash, therefore I created this terminal application to keep a record of spending.

#### To run the application
- Open terminal at the folder "Single-user-banking-script"
- run "Python atm.py"

##### Log files
 - Bank Data.txt stores your account balance
 - Transaction log.txt stores the transaction logs.


#### Future wishes
- Data analysis of user log files. Would be lovely to have monthly/yearly stats, as well as graphs to plot income and spending. 
- Simple GUI
- Batch file to run program without terminal know-how.
